Module to host a Django application from within a CherryPy server.

Instead of creating a clone to `runserver` like other similar
packages do, we simply setup and host the Django application
using WSGI and CherryPy's capabilities to serve it.

In order to configure the application, we use the `settings.configure(...)`
function provided by Django.

Since the CherryPy WSGI server doesn't offer a log
facility, we add a straightforward WSGI middleware to do so, based
on the CherryPy built-in logger. Obviously any other log middleware
can be used instead.

For some extra fun we demonstrate how to add WebSocket support
to your Django application. This requires ws4py:

https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python

Note this application admin site uses the following credentials:
admin/admin

Thanks to Damien Tougas for his help on this recipe.
